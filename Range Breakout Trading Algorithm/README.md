## Range Breakout Trading Algorithm
This trading algorithm uses a breakout of a consolidation in prices as the basis for making trades.
Such a period of consolidation can be found throughout the day, whether it is a certain trading session or slow periods during the day. One can find such periods through volume analysis as well.

The aim of this algorithm is to create a template algorithm, designed not to be an out-of-the-box profit churner, but rather to provide a framework for the user to mould to a specific strategy.

Here is the basic algorithm:



Here is the algorithm in action, with a profitable trade taken after a breakout:
